## Usage
To use the ATM program, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can then enter your PIN and select an option to withdraw or deposit money. The program will then prompt you to enter the amount of money you want to withdraw or deposit. The balance will be updated automatically and displayed to you.
